      <span>Augusta Ada King</span>, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10
      December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer,
      chiefly known for her work on <span>Charles Babbage's</span> proposed
      mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the
      first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
      calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out
      by such a machine. As a result, she is widely regarded as the first to
      recognise the full potentialof computers and one of the first computer
      programmers.

      Augusta Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and his
      wife Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to
      other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and
      left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a
      poem that begins,
      <span class="quote">
        "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my
        house and heart?".
      </span>
      He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight
      years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in
      mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her
      father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in
      Byron, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she
      was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her
      childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King
      in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming
      Countess of Lovelace.

      Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with
      scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster,
      Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens,
      contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her
      approach as "poetical science"[8] and herself as an "Analyst (&
      Metaphysician)".[9]

      When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long
      working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician
      Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers". She was in
      particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace
      first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private
      tutor, Mary Somerville.

      Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military
      engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with
      an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what
      many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm
      designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this
      perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years
      1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[10] Lovelace's notes
      are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a
      vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or
      number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused
      only on those capabilities.[11] Her mindset of "poetical science" led her
      to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes)
      examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a
      collaborative tool.[6]

      She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.
