CSS:  Classes and IDs

The style.css file is already started for you. There are two class selectors for two 
color options: .red and .blue. These are here mainly as examples, but you may wish to
use them. There is also a #title id selector, as well as the img and body elements. 

In the index.html file you will see some <span> </span> tags, with classes set to "person" 
and "thing".  Notice also that there is a last paragraph with a class="source" attribute.

Your tasks:
1. Change the person and places on the doc to display as different colors.
