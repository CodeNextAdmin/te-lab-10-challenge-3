CSS:  Classes and IDs

The style.css file is already started for you. There are two class selectors for two 
color options: .red and .blue. These are here mainly as examples, but you may wish to
use them. There is also a #title id selector, as well as the img and body elements. 
There is also a quote span. 

In the index.html file you will see some <span> </span> tags, with classes set to "person" 
and "thing".  Notice also that there is a last paragraph with a class="source" attribute.
Each paragraph is preceded by an h3 subheading tag.
 

Your tasks:
=================
1. Change the person and places on the doc to display as different colors, and make bold.
2. Use the id selector to style the title
3. Change fonts. Give all the headings the same font, different from the paragraphs
4. The source at the bottom should be smaller than the regular paragraphs, and a lighter color
5. Make the quote stand out with margins, color, etc.
6. Add some new classes and IDs and play around with this page. Make stuff up, its ok.
